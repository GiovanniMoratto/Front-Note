# CS50 - Final Project
This final project was created to get graduated from the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course. In this project, we were free to create a project of our own, using any of the languages we have learned in the course. It should be something that solves an actual problem of our community.

## Front-Note
When we create an HTML page using an IDE, we must change to another browser tab and refresh the page the whole time to see what the page looks like and check if there are no bugs. On Front-Note, it will be possible to see the pages' changes while coding without changing the pages and refreshing them. It will be able to see the results right away.

This project was made for students and people interested in web development. It will be created using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery, a JavaScript library) to publish it on GitHub and [github pages](https://giovannimoratto.github.io/Front-Note/). It will be possible for the community to use it online or even to clone the repository and use it on their computer if they want to.

Will be published under MIT license, which allows all the people to use and change the program; however, they want or need to. The user can even use it as part of their program if they want to without permission. Referencing the rights would be nice but is not extremely necessary.

## How to use it
* Visit the site on https://giovannimoratto.github.io/Front-Note/. Just click on the START button and begin writing code on the Front-Note.
* There are going to be three tabs on the left side of the screen:
    * HTML - Write the structure of the website.
    * CSS - Give the website a bit of color and style.
    * JS - Let the website interact using both JavaScript and jQuery functions.
* There is also an "X" on the right side of the tabs to hide the tabs so that you can see your website's full screen.
* To show the coding tabs again, click on the floating "</>" button on the site's top left.
* It will be able to clone the repository to a computer to use it offline, to change it, or to include it on another project using the following terminal command:

```git clone https://github.com/GiovanniMoratto/Front-Note.git```


## Conclusion
From the start with Scratch on the first week to understand variables, functions, and loops, to programming in c to understand algorithms, memory, and data structure and programming in Python to understand abstraction (and make life much more comfortable) was one of my best coding experiences. This project made me stop copying codes and made me understand what I was doing and why. All the problem sets were also mind-blowing. The project made me spend hours reading documentation and articles in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (and now I also know the meaning of this website's name); moreover, it taught me where to find the right information.

My chosen track was Web because that is what I like and why I started to code. The necessary frontend codes (tags and functions) are quite simple to understand, but when you start to go deeper in CSS, like understanding differences between margin and padding and working with flexbox, grid, or positions, arguments can get a bit tricky. DOM manipulation with JavaScript can be a big challenge as well. Having a tool that allows someone to see the changes happening while he writes his code will help him understand these tricky and challenging parts faster.

I want to thank David J. Malan, Brian Yu, Doug Lloyd, and all the others involved in this project for their fantastic work, and I hope to see you guys soon in CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.
